# mergekit-evolve について

Sakana.ai made a very big splash about a month ago, releasing a paper on Evolutionary Model Merging, and the subsequent model and eval results of this game-changing merge method. Unfortunately for the community, they never released the algorithm behind these amazing results!

Since this release, here at Arcee we've been fully focused on developing this groundbreaking technique for the community. We're now excited to announce the launch of this state-of-the-art functionality in MergeKit.

Evolutionary Model Merging lets people target specific competencies or qualities in their merges. Without it, Model Merging is an extremely manual exploratory process–trying dozens of merges, manually evaluating them, and trying to come up with a mental framework that explains how the merging parameters are related to the performance of the final model. With Evolutionary Model Merging, we can instead specify what qualities we want a model to have, and optimization will take care of it for us.
